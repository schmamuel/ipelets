Some ipelets I wrote.

## decoration respecting align ##

This ipelet is a slight variation of the standart ipelet "align & distribute". The functionality is the same, except that aligns decorated objects differently.

## layer sensitive grouping ##

This ipelet changes the "group" and "ungroup" actions to not change the layer of the objects if possible.

## regular n gon ##

This ipelet is a slight variation of the action "regular k gon" that is included in the "goodies" ipelet. The functionality is he same, except that the n gon always has one side that is parallel to the x-axis.

## rename unused layers ##

Using this ipelet renames all unused layers, i.e. never visible, on the current page by adding the prefix "unused" to the name of the layer.
